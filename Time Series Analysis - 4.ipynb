    "# Time Series Analysis - Part 4 :  ARCH and GARCH models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final notebook on time series analysis, we will discuss conditional heteroskedasticity, leading us to our first conditional heteroskedastic model, known as ARCH. Then we will discuss extensions to ARCH, leading us to the famous Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model of order p,q, also known as GARCH(p,q). GARCH is used extensively within the financial industry as many asset prices are conditional heteroskedastic."
